# Public Review of the class (Spring 2016)

Optionally, add lines to the following sections as a review of the class.
Reminder: these are public; for private course evaluations follow the University's regular options to do so.
Objective: to know what to improve, and to provide this list to students of the course next semester.

## Things that should be added to the syllabus:

1. Extensions on programming assignment deadlines only when there are official University-wide delays, 
or there are situations out of control by all students (such as when the Linux accounts were delayed).

2. Failing homework 0 (anything below 60) will require the student to talk with some kind of academic advisor in case that the student decides to continue with the class.

3. Any lack of politeness, or lack of professional behaviour to other students, instructor, or TAs will not be tolerated. The student with a behaviour out of place will be asked to discuss their situation with the relevant University personnel that is experienced in this matters. The minimum outcome will be an email notification to the student of their unprofessional behaviour, with copy to the academic and/or undergraduate advisor (of the Department).

## Stuff the instructor needs to improve:

2.

## Stuff the TA needs to do better:

## Things to do better in terms of linux accounts:

## Other things to improve/suggestion(s):

1. Have "lab" office hours.

2. Evenly distributed grade distribution. Rather than 70/30 only distribution -- maybe have assignments related to theory as well? two tests instead of one heavy weighted test?

## Wishlist

1. A "grade-calculator", or "grade-estimator" where students can type their grades so far, and they would get an estimate of their total grade (from 0 - 100).

2. Improvements in automated-grading.
